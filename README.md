Welcome to Kuuzu!

We are ready to share our new foundation with you and are excited to create a
new, fast and simple open source cart.

The v1.0 beta will focus on bringing the framework up to speed so as to to start building onto. 
Until officially released, the software as is will not
to be able to run an online store, however the plan is to create a 
delivery mechanism that will easily upgrade running installations.

Be aware that before final release the updates may break your store.
